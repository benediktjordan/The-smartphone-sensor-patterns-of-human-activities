# Automatic Identification of User-Contexts Based on Smartphone Sensors in Naturalistic Settings

## Project Description

This project develops machine learning models to identify user contexts linked with smartphone overuse based on smartphone sensor data. Four user contexts have been in focus: human motion, transportation mode, important locations, and lying in bed before or after sleep. The aim was to identify these contexts based on data from 14 different smartphone sensors, namely motion-, location-, phone-related-, and environmental sensors.  The project's goal is to aid in understanding and reducing smartphone overuse. The data was collected in a naturalistic setting. 

The project was created during the master thesis in the masterÂ´s program "Computational Modeling and Simulation" with a major in "Computational Life Sciences" at the TU Dresden (Germany) by Benedikt Jordan. The thesis was supervised by Lennart Schaepermeier and Prof. Kerschke from the chair of Big Data Analytics in Transportation. 

## Repository Content

This repository contains the Python code developed for the project. The codebase includes various modules for data loading, preprocessing, peak detection, noise detection, transformation, and machine learning classification. The key components are:

- data loading and exploration
- initial label and sensor transformations
- merging and imputations to cope with missing values and combine different sensor data 
- feature extraction: different for specific sensors
- modeling: creation, training and evaluation of machine learning models

## Project Results
The project aimed at identifying in real time four different user contexts based on smartphone sensor data. Subsequently, the main results are presented: 

### Human Motion 

- Human Motion: Detected four human motion activities with a balanced accuracy of 64%.

    Important Locations: Identified "home" and "office" locations with recalls of 85% and 80%, respectively, using only GPS data.
    Lying in Bed Before and After Sleep: Detected with recalls of 72% and 50%.
    The models show potential in real-life applications for mitigating smartphone overuse.
    
## Data Structure 

Data collected included smartphone sensor data (like GPS, accelerometer) and self-reported information through experience sampling (ES). This data was used to analyze various contexts like human motion, important locations, and periods of lying in bed before and after sleep.

## Methodology

The project follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model, involving:

    Data Collection: Data was gathered from 18 participants over an average of 12 days in naturalistic settings.
    Data Exploration: Involved creating generic maps from GPS data and exploring sensor data.
    Data Preparation: Techniques included ES answers transformation, feature creation, and data-driven feature selection.
    Modeling: Machine learning models and other necessary methods were applied for analysis.

Key Findings

    Human Motion: Detected four human motion activities with a balanced accuracy of 64%.
    Important Locations: Identified "home" and "office" locations with recalls of 85% and 80%, respectively, using only GPS data.
    Lying in Bed Before and After Sleep: Detected with recalls of 72% and 50%.
    The models show potential in real-life applications for mitigating smartphone overuse.
